= How to search for Modules

You can search for modules in Pantheon using the following tools:

* A keyword search in the search bar.
* Filtering the search by one or more of the available filter drop-down lists.
** Product category
** Product version number
** Module type (Concept, Procedure, or Reference) 
** Upload date

The search results are presented in a table that displays the module title, whether it has been published or not, the date the draft was uploaded, and the module type.
